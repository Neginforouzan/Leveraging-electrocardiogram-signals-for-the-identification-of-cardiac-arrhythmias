# **Arrhythmia Detection Using Machine Learning**

This project explores various machine learning methods for detecting arrhythmias from ECG signals, utilizing the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. We evaluate different algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forests (RF). The primary objective is to identify the most effective techniques for arrhythmia detection, with the goal of improving early diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.

## **Project Overview**

The early diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias are critical to preventing severe cardiovascular complications. In this project, we employ machine learning techniques to classify ECG signals and detect different types of arrhythmias. By comparing the performance of several classification algorithms, we aim to determine which model best identifies arrhythmias, facilitating advancements in healthcare technologies.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, which contains over 100,000 samples of ECG signals with annotations for various types of arrhythmias. (You can download the dataset from Kaggle)

### **Dataset Structure**

- **.csv files**: Contain the ECG signals for each patient.
- **.txt files**: Include annotations for each heartbeat, specifying the type of arrhythmia.

## **Modeling Approaches**

We implemented and compared the following machine learning models:

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**
- **Decision Trees (DT)**
- **Random Forests (RF)**

### **Evaluation Metrics**

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

## **Results**

The best-performing model achieved the following results (hypothetical outcomes, please update with actual results):

- **Accuracy**: 98%
- **Precision**: 98%
- **Recall**: 98%
- **F1 Score**: 98%

The CNN model showed superior performance, particularly in detecting complex arrhythmias. However, other models like Random Forest also performed well with specific types of arrhythmias.

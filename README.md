# Leveraging-electrocardiogram-signals-for-the-identification-of-cardiac-arrhythmias
  Cardiovascular diseases are a significant global health concern, with cardiac arrhythmias being a particularly serious risk to patient wellbeing. The use of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for the early and precise detection of arrhythmias is crucial for prompt and effective treatment. Machine learning-based methods play a crucial role in in the automatic identification of intricate patterns within ECG data, which can be harnessed for arrhythmia detection.
In this study, we have conducted an exhaustive examination of machine learning methods for arrhythmia detection using ECG signals. The performance of these methods was evaluated based on several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. The methods utilized in this study encompass artificial neural networks, k-nearest neighbors algorithm, convolutional neural network algorithm, deep neural networks, decision tree algorithm, and the random forest algorithm.
This comparative study aims to shed light on which of these methods hold the most promise for effective arrhythmia detection. By identifying the most potent techniques, we hope to contribute to the ongoing efforts to combat cardiovascular diseases and improve patient outcomes.
